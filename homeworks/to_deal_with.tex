\textbf{1. Lunar Eclipse} 
This question guides you through some basic image processing techniques in MATLAB.
You will create interesting images with relational and logical indexing,
as well as the \emph{imshow} function to visualize what you have created. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a $100 \times 100$ $A$ where its contents are all ones.

    \item Create a $100 \times 100$ $B$ where its contents are all zeros.

    \item In matrix $A$, set the values of entry $a_{i,j}$ equal to 0 if $\sqrt{(i-50)^2 + (j-50)^2} < 20$.
    \textbf{Hint} : \textbf{\textit{meshgrid}} would be useful in creating the indices.

    \item In matrix $B$, set the values of entry $a_{i,j}$ equal to 1 if $\sqrt{(i-40)^2 + (j-40)^2} < 20$.

    \item Visualize the following results with \textbf{\textit{figure}} and \textbf{\textit{imshow}}. 
    Describe each of the results with one sentence each. 

        \begin{itemize}
        \item $A$
        \item $B$
        \item Intersection between $A$ and $B$
        \item Union between $A$ and $B$
        \item Complement of intersection between $A$ and $B$
        \item Complement of union between $A$ and $B$
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
